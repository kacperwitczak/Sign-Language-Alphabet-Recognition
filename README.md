The aim of this project was to implement an application allowing recognition of the American Sign Language alphabet. The application consists of four modules. The first one is the GUI, enabling data collection. The second module deals with video processing into csv files. The third module is the neural network. The fourth module allows you to recognize the sign alphabet IN REAL TIME.
